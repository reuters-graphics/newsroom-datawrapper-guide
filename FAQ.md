## Frequently asked questions

#### I want a chart: Datawrapper or Reuters Graphics?

If you have a chart idea and it fits one the chart types Datawrapper provides for, then the fastest route to the chart you want is through Datawrapper.

Even though we can only pick up a few of the chart requests we receive on our team, we always encourage you to submit your ideas to [all.graphics@thomsonreuters.com](mailto:all.graphics@thomsonreuters.com). In many cases, we'll expand on an idea in conversation and find opportunities to build even more engaging dataviz in your data. (When approaching us, it's always best to send us some data as early as possible.)

If we're already booked up, though, we'll be clear with you and hope to catch you on the next one.

#### Who can help me with my chart?

Be sure you've read through the documentation on this site to see if your question is already answered. If you're still stuck on a particular chart, you can ask questions in the [Datawrapper helpline](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a2cfe992b82e14e599bd7ad7eca59c324%40thread.skype/%25E2%2598%258E%25EF%25B8%258F%2520Datawrapper%2520helpline?groupId=c0949280-94a2-469a-a719-12397824db0a&tenantId=62ccb864-6a1a-4b5d-8e1c-397dec1a8258) Teams channel.

This channel creates a space where anyone from the newsroom can help with chart issues. The Graphics team will make our best attempt to help here, too, but unfortunately, we can't staff this channel to answer every question.

#### Who edits Datawrapper charts?

The Graphics team does not edit or review all charts created in Datawrapper. (We do regularly make some newsroom created charts available to clients in Connect, which we _do_ review.)

In general, though, your regular editor is your editor for Datawrapper charts. Make sure you show your charts to them before including in your stories.

Charts should also be copyedited, just like any other piece of reporting.

#### What's the Reuters Graphics team's role in supporting Datawrapper?

The Graphics team supports the software that publishes Datawrapper charts to our Reuters servers. We also maintain the Datawrapper charts channel in Teams and the training materials you're reading now as well as hosting occassional office hours sessions to talk about charting with the newsroom.

We do not usually have the capacity to assist in making individual charts, but we'll always try to help where we can and are keen to coach on techniques for making better charts.
