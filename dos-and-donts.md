## Datawrapper Dos and Don'ts

This guide will help you make clear charts that tell compelling stories.

#### Label those units! Preferably, on the axes.

This is easiest to do in the "Check & Describe" tab:

This will add the dollar sign to the y-axis label:

#### Express large numbers as decimals

All of those zeros take up space. Divide or multiply to get clean decimal style numbers.

See above for adding the "K" (thousands) "M" (millions), "B" (billions), etc.

#### Do you need all of those variables?

Spaghetti charts are hard to parse. If you can eliminate variables from your dataset, or combine several categories into "Other", you're chart will be much easier to read.

#### Every pie chart would be better as a bar chart.

Human brains are bad at comparing slice sizes to one another. The difference between 30% and 40%, for example, is not very dramatic when represented as a pie chart.

Bars, however, are very easy to compare!

Pie charts are almost always better as bar charts.

#### Should your bar chart be rotated?

If you are comparing a lot of categories, Datawrapper might rotate your labels. Rotated labels are hard to read. The easy fix is to simply rotate to horizontal bars.

#### Remove to improve

Too many colors, labels, axes labels, etc... can make your chart harder to read. You don't want to overload the reader. When in doubt, fall back on the mantra, "Remove to Improve."
