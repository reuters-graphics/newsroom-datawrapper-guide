### Making your first chart

These next sections will walk you through the basics of creating a chart in Datawrapper.

#### Preparing your data and uploading to Datawrapper

All charts start with clean data, and most of that data should come from a spreadsheet. But just because your data is in a spreadsheet does not mean it's ready to chart with.

Almost all data should be "square" with a single header row describing your data and individual datapoints listed down the columns, just like this:

If your data is not square, you may need to reformat it by hand or use a [pivot table](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-pivottable-to-analyze-worksheet-data-a9a84538-bfe9-40a9-a8e9-f99134456576) in Excel. You can also try tools like Stanford's [DataWrangler](http://vis.stanford.edu/wrangler/) for more complex data transformations.

Once your data is ready, you can sign in to Datawrapper and start a new chart.

In most cases, you'll simple copy and paste your data from your spreadsheet into the text box on the "Upload Data" tab of your chart like this:

You can also upload your entire spreadsheet directly, connect to a Google sheet or link up with a live JSON or CSV API.

With your data prepped and uploaded, click "Proceed" to take you to the "Check and Describe" tab.

In this step, you can make sure Datawrapper is correctly parsing and interpretting your data. Common problems are things like years being treated as numbers instead of dates or numbers being parsed incorrectly as text. You can also divide or round columns of numbers in this step to make your chart more readable.

To change the format, click a column header ("A", "B", "C", etc. below) and choose the right options for your data in the panel left of the table.

Once your data is correctly formatted, uploaded and parsed, you're ready to start charting.
