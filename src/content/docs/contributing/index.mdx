import { FileTree, Steps, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

All Reuters Graphics staff are welcome and encouraged to add to and improve this guide. All contributions must be made [in the GitHub repo for this project](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/newsroom-datawrapper-guide).

## Structure of the Project
This site is built using [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) and the [Astro](https://astro.build/) web framework. But in most cases, you'll only need to know a bit of basic [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) syntax to contribute documentation.

All documentation files are stored as `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs` directory. Each [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) file creates a corresponding page on this site. Nested pages create more complex URLs.

<FileTree>
- src
  - content
    - docs
      - index.mdx Home page
      - tutorials
        - my-tutorial.mdx A page at `/tutorials/my-tutorial/`
</FileTree>

## Updating existing pages

If you're editing typos, updating links or adding simple instructions to an existing page, you can make those changes directly in GitHub and commit to `main`.

For more substantial edits, follow a normal GitHub flow:

<Steps>

1. **Create a new branch**: Clone [this repo](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/newsroom-datawrapper-guide), if you haven't already, and create a new branch.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

2. **Edit the MDX file**: 
   - Navigate to the `src/content/docs/` directory.
   - Open the file for the page you want to edit and make your changes.
  
3. **Commit your changes**:
   After making changes, commit them with a meaningful message and push your branch to GitHub.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "My docs edit"
   git push origin your-branch-name

4. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**: 
   - Go to GitHub and open a PR from your branch to the `main` branch.
   - Add a clear description of your changes for review.
</Steps>

## Adding new pages

<Steps>
1. **Create a new branch**: 
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

2. **Add a new MDX file**: 
   - Navigate to the `src/content/docs/` directory.
   - Create a new `.mdx` file for your page.
     - For example, if you want to add a new page about creating choropleth maps, you might create a file called `choropleth-maps.mdx`.
   - Start the file with a YAML frontmatter section that includes at least a `title` field:
     ```mdx
     ---
     title: Choropleth Maps
     description: How to create choropleth maps using Datawrapper.
     ---
     ```

3. **Write your content**: Use Markdown and MDX features to structure your content. You can also use any of Starlight's [built-in MDX components](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/components/):
   ```mdx
   ---
   title: Choropleth Maps
   ---

   import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

   ## Upload Your Data

   Follow these steps to upload your dataset to Datawrapper...

   <Aside type="caution">Be sure your data is formatted properly!</Aside>
   ```

</Steps>

## Images

When adding images to accompany your documentation, please save them _near_ the MDX file they belong to, typically in an `images/` subdirectory within the same folder as the MDX file you're working on.

You can then import the image directly into your MDX file and place it in your content:

```mdx
import MapImage from './images/choropleth-example.png';

## Example Choropleth Map

Hereâ€™s what a choropleth map looks like:

<img src={MapImage.src} />
```

## Adding a page to the site nav

To add your new page to the sidebar nav, you must add an item to the `SIDEBAR` array in the `astro.config.mjs` file in the root of this project with a `label` and `slug` which represents the path to your page.

```typescript
const SIDEBAR = [
	// ...
	{
		label: 'My new tutorial',
		slug: 'tutorials/my-new-tutorial',
	},
];

```

## Starting the dev server

<Steps>
1. Install dependencies using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/):

      ```bash
      pnpm i
      ```

      <Aside type="tip">
         This repo uses pnpm, which is a package manager, like yarn or npm, but cooler. If you don\'t have it, you can install it with npm:

         ```bash
         npm install -g pnpm
         ```
      </Aside>

2. Run the dev server:

      ```bash
      pnpm dev
      ```
</Steps>

## Publishing Changes

Once your PR is approved and merged or any changes have been made to the `main` branch, the site will automatically be republished through a GitHub Action.
