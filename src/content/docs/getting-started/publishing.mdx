import TeamsCard from './images/teams-publish-card.png';
import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

With your chart ready, go to the **"Publish & Embed"** tab to publish your chart. Click the **"Publish chart"** button.

<Aside type="caution">Do not use any of the export or embed options directly from Datawrapper to embed charts. We'll provide you options that use a version of your chart hosted on Reuters servers.</Aside>



Behind the scenes, Reuters Graphics' bots will intercept and repackage your chart from Datawrapper, upload it to Reuters-owned servers and give you back the right links to use your charts in stories in the [**Datawrapper Charts channel in Teams**](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a489aacae4e19400d8cf0da402c021076%40thread.skype/%25F0%259F%2593%2588Datawrapper%2520charts?groupId=c0949280-94a2-469a-a719-12397824db0a&tenantId=62ccb864-6a1a-4b5d-8e1c-397dec1a8258).

In that channel, a card for your chart will be generated with several links including to a static image of your chart, an interactive version and a link to the chart hosted in the [Graphics Portal](https://sphinx.thomsonreuters.com/graphics/#/group/rngs).
