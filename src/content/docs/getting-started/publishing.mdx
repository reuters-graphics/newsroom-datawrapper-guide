import TeamsCard from './images/teams-publish-card.png';
import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

With your chart ready, go to the **"Publish & Embed"** tab to publish your chart. Click the **"Publish chart"** button.

<Aside type="caution">Do not use any of the export or embed options directly from Datawrapper to embed charts. We'll provide you options that use a version of your chart hosted on Reuters servers.</Aside>



Behind the scenes, Reuters Graphics' bots will intercept and repackage your chart from Datawrapper, upload it to Reuters-owned servers and give you back the right links to use your charts in stories in the [**Datawrapper Charts channel in Teams**](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a489aacae4e19400d8cf0da402c021076%40thread.skype/%25F0%259F%2593%2588Datawrapper%2520charts?groupId=c0949280-94a2-469a-a719-12397824db0a&tenantId=62ccb864-6a1a-4b5d-8e1c-397dec1a8258).

In that channel, a card for your chart will be generated with several links including to a static image of your chart, an interactive version and a link to the chart hosted in the [Graphics Portal](https://sphinx.thomsonreuters.com/graphics/#/group/rngs).

<img src={TeamsCard.src} style={{ maxWidth: '350px' }} />

### Using your chart in Lynx

For now, the only charts Lynx will accept are static images, **not** interactive versions. So choose the "Image" link from the card in Teams or use the Graphics Portal to get the same.

See [this short instructional guide](http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/data/Embedding_graphics_in_Lynx.pdf) for a demonstration of how to then embed your chart in Lynx or ask the desk for help getting your chart in your story.

Remember to get your chart in front of your editor _before_ you add it to your story.
